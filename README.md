Big project, for school final project but done alone
Instructions: implement an application that uses an RMDB

What I made: MovieREC!
-- user enters a movie, they get 10 movies back, along with the IMDB links and their posters
-- user can also take notes in a journal (kept by a database)
-- login/sign-up pages allow user to create an account
-- top 10 IMDB movies are also displayed on a page

Components:
-- look at report and slideshow pdfs for a better idea
-- web pages (HTML), DB (SQL-alchemy + Flask), and python files (KNN machine learning model, web scraping with beautiful soup, threading to BS4 faster, blueprints for the HTML pgs, overall logic and handling of GET and POST requests, DB communication)
